Protovis Loader
===============

The plugin is now [up on Wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/protovis-loader/) which means I have had to put it into a SVN repository. I'm experimenting with git-svn so that I can continue to work with git, but it probably means that I will have to close this version of the repository here.
