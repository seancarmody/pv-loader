Protovis Loader
===============

The plugin is now [up on Wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/protovis-loader/) which means I have had to put it into a SVN repository. I am now mmanaging it with git-svn, which means I have had to move it to a [new repository](http://github.com/seancarmody/Protovis-Loader).
